# WeatherStation2.0

An attempt at a ESP8266 "Weather/Environment logger" type of project. The idea is to have the possibility to have several ESP8266 or ESP32 "sensor units" gathering 
various weather/climate/environment data and logging this to a database. This data will then be available for display through a web interface.
